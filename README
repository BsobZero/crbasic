Microgrid Assessment Tool
--------------------------
As a firmware programmer at Smart Resource Institute I coded these programs
in CRBasic for a device called a datalogger.


CR1000                                   ( https://www.campbellsci.com/cr1000 )
-------
The datalogger; specifically, Campbell Scientific's CR1000, was used as a hub
device that connected to other devices. Together the devices quantified resources
such as energy collected from solar panels, speed and direction of wind, temperatures
in room locations, water expenditure, and electicity consumption.

Since we had solar panels on the roof, we often gave back to the grid and burlington
electric had to pay us. So it was amusing to see the challenging energy forces and
being able to see the results concretely.


Purpose / Product
------------------
The product of these programs created the Microgrid Assessment Tool which is a solution
for clients to see all resource exhaustion on a single dashboard: catering to the idea
of energy management. This work primarily supplied backend data that was presented using
a series of visual graphical displays.


Targets
-------
This product targeted and would be the most useful to huge companies that have a hard time
keeping track of resources across many chains. Also, it would be valuable to industries that
disburse large amounts of resource as apart of business. For this reason, ECHO Lake Aquarium
Science center was one of our pitches.


MGA's Rollout
--------------
The Microgrid Assessment Tool was administered in North Carolina with the new medical transport
company MED-1. This company is a first reponse call to disasters and they bring out tractor
trailers with solar panel on the roof to the scene: bringing medical attention to victims instead
of having to ship them to a far away hospital.

The tool was also featured at the Democratic National Convention.
